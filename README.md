Given the recent buzz around the New York City mayoral election and its use of ranked-choice voting (a basic explanation of which can be found here: (https://ballotpedia.org/Ranked-choice_voting_(RCV)#Background), we have created a project to simulate the ballot counting and show how a majority winner would not necessarily win a ranked-choice election.
 
The task is to implement SimpleElection.CountVotes() and RankedChoiceElection.CountVotes() in such a way that their respective ElectionRunners will return the correct winner of the election based on the voting system (you may also want to take a look at ElectionRunner.cs).

Changes can be made to anything in the solution, including the BallotGenerators, which currently just generate 100,000 random votes.
 
The submission should include a short explanation of your solution and any unit tests you used along the way.
